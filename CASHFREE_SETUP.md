## Environment Variable Details

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CASHFREE_APP_ID` | Your Cashfree App ID (Client ID) | `1234567890abcdef` |

## Setup Steps

1. **Create `.env.local` file** in the root directory (same level as `package.json`)

2. **Add the environment variables** as shown above

3. **Restart your Next.js development server** after adding environment variables:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **For production**, set these as environment variables in your hosting platform (Vercel, Railway, etc.)

## Testing

- Use **sandbox** environment for testing
- Test payments with Cashfree test cards
- Check Cashfree dashboard for payment logs

## Important Notes

- ⚠️ **Never commit `.env.local` to git** - it should be in `.gitignore`
- 🔒 Keep your Secret Key secure
- 🧪 Use `sandbox` for development and testing
- 🚀 Switch to `production` only when ready for live payments

## Troubleshooting

### "Payment gateway not configured" Error
- Check that all environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure `.env.local` is in the root directory
- Restart your development server after adding variables
- Verify variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Payment Order Creation Fails
- Verify your App ID and Secret Key are correct
- Check that you're using the correct environment (sandbox vs production)
- Ensure your Cashfree account is active
- Check Cashfree dashboard for API error logs
