# Microservices Framework Rules

## 1. Clear Service Boundaries
- Each service represents a single business capability.
- Services must be independently deployable and modifiable.
- Boundaries should align with business domains, not technical layers.

## 2. Loose Coupling & High Cohesion
- Services communicate only via stable APIs or events.
- No service may access another service’s database directly.
- Changes in one service must not force changes in others.

## 3. API & Contract Design
- APIs must be versioned, documented, and explicit.
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible.
- Use consistent request/response patterns across services.

## 4. Data Ownership
- Each service owns and manages its own data store.
- Cross-service data sharing must occur via APIs or events.
- Prefer event-driven propagation for shared data needs.

## 5. Resilience & Fault Tolerance
- All network calls must include timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers.
- Services should handle dependency failures gracefully.
- Always design with partial failures in mind.

## 6. Observability
- Use structured logs with correlation/trace IDs.
- Provide standard metrics and health endpoints.
- Implement distributed tracing across services.

## 7. Deployment & Configuration
- Each service must use an independent CI/CD pipeline.
- Configuration must be externalized and specific per environment.
- Use immutable build artifacts across all environments.

## 8. Security
- Service-to-service communication must be authenticated.
- Secrets must be stored in a secure vault, not in source code.
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all access.

## 9. Statelessness & Scalability
- Services must be stateless; otherwise use external state stores.
- Prefer horizontal scaling (running multiple instances).

## 10. Consistency & Distributed Workflows
- Prefer eventual consistency over distributed ACID transactions.
- Use sagas or orchestration for multi-service workflows.

## 11. Testing & Quality
- Include unit, integration, and contract tests for each service.
- Execute automated smoke tests after deployments.

## 12. Ownership & Documentation
- Each service must have a clearly assigned owning team.
- Maintain minimal documentation:
  - Service purpose  
  - APIs/events  
  - Dependencies  
  - Runbook for operations
